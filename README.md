# Music-blogger

This project was created with the intent to be a public place for music lovers to create a unique user as well as posts about their favorite music and allows the user to create, delete, update, and see entries they persisted to the backend. This file is the ruby on rails backend that contains all of my code for my project. This repository is also the source needed to run backend server. You can find the frontend here on github: https://github.com/thakaj/music-blogger-frontend

How to Acess:

1. Clone this repository to your local enviornment.
2. Run the command bundle install in your terminal to download the required gems to run this backend.
3. Once they've been installed the required gems run the command rails s to start the backend server.
4. Once it is up and running switch over to the react frontend application. Which can be located here on github: https://github.com/thakaj/music-blogger-frontend
